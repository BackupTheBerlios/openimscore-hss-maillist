<PRE>Hi Guys,

 

Consider the following subscriber profile where a public identity is linked
with 2 private identities:

 

We have the couple:

 

Private 1 &lt;-&gt; Public 1

Private 2 &lt;-&gt; Public 1

 

Consider to make a registration of the Private 1 &lt;-&gt; Public 1. The following
message will be exchanged between the x-CSCF and the HSS: UAR-UAA, MAR-MAA,
UAR-UAA, SAR (REGISTRATION)-SAA. After that, the registration status of the
Private 1 &lt;-&gt; Public 1 should be REGISTERED if everything was fine.

 

Now, make the same thing for the link Private 2 &lt;-&gt; Public 2. Same messages
will be exchanged and the registration status should be also REGISTERED for
that link.

 

Private 1 &lt;-&gt; Public 1 =&gt; REGISTERED

Private 2 &lt;-&gt; Public 1 =&gt; REGISTERED

 

 

Now consider to deregister the first link Private 1 &lt;-&gt; Public 1 by sending
an SAR with USER_DEREGISTRATION(5) in the ServerAssignmentType AVP.

 

The 3GPP TS 29.228 states the following:

-     If it indicates TIMEOUT_DEREGISTRATION, USER_DEREGISTRATION,
DEREGISTRATION_TOO_MUCH_DATA or ADMINISTRATIVE_DEREGISTRATION, the HSS shall
check the registration state for all the Public Identities in the request.
If the request did not contain Public Identities the HSS shall check the
registration state of the Public Identities associated with the Private
Identity identified in the request. For each Public Identity;-

-     if the registration state of the Public User Identity is Registered,
the HSS shall check if the Public User Identity is currently registered with
one or more Private User Identities. 

-     If the Public User Identity is currently registered with only one
Private User Identity, the HSS shall set the registration state of the
Public User Identity to Not Registered and clear the S-CSCF name associated
with the Public User Identity.

-     If the Public User Identity is currently registered with more than one
Private User Identity, the HSS shall keep the registration state of the
Public User Identity as Registered and retain the S-CSCF name associated
with the Public User Identity.

-     if the registration state of the Public Identity is Unregistered, the
HSS shall set the registration state of the Public Identity to Not
Registered and clear the S-CSCF name associated with the Public Identity.

The Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS

So as the Public 1 is linked with more than one Private identity (ie the
Private 2) with is also REGISTERED, the Registration state is not modified
and kept to REGISTERED.

 

 

Finally deregister the second link Private 2 &lt;-&gt; Public 1 by sending a SAR
with USER_DEREGISTRATION(5) in the serverAssignmentType.

As the Public 1 is linked with the Private 1 which is always in REGISTERED
state, the registration status for this link is also kept to REGISTERED.

 

My question is:

 

How a user could be DEREGISTERED using this configuration? 

The Registration State could never switch to NOT_REGISTER once the 2 links
have been registered. 

Is it allowed to keep the Registration status to REGISTERED even if a user
asked for a DEREGISTRATION ?

The only way I see to DEREGISTER such theses links, is by sending a RTR
message from the HSS. But that imply an manual operator action on the HSS to
Deregister a user.

 

Thanks for your comment/answer.

 

Jean-Christophe Cimino.

<PRE>Hi Luca,

I remember about a month ago you were looking for someone working on accounting. Incase you were referring to charging in the IMS, we have released an initial implementation of charging for IPtv services for the IMS. The system supports online and offline charging for the UCT advanced IPtv server. It is easy to install and use.

Note: since the UCT IPtv server was only tested with the UCT IMS client, this charging release has only been tested with these systems. Your contribution to the development is highly welcome.

 

For more information on the release, visit

Regards,

Vitalis.

Hello Luca,

about a year ago I had a student on the university who started to implement an Rf (off-line charging) interface to OpenIMSCore. Due to lack of time she could not finish the work. Meanwhile I have sent the available work including the available code to at least three different people but no result so far.

Now again I have a student who is very interested to work in this field (off-line and on-line charging). But he just started with the thesis and I cannot predict when a result will be available (maybe end of summer).

<PRE>Hi,

Firstly, this is my first mail to the list and I just want to offer my
thanks to all those involved in the OpenIMS project - it is a great
accomplishment.

I am currently trying to get to grips with the intricate details of the Cx
interface on the HSS. I have been through all the code line by line so as to
get a solid understanding on the system. A question I have is what was the
specification against which the HSS (or in this case the Cx specifically)
was built. I can see a lot of detailed implementation decisions in the code
and cant quite work out if these are implementation specific or obeying a
certain standard/spec/rfc.

I have been through 3GPP TS 29.229 and RFC 4740 and RFC 3588 yet none of
them define things to the level of detail covered in the HSS. Let me use an
example - in the Cx UAR request, FHoSS checks if the IMPU is allowed to
register as per its can_register value in the DB, and even if its an
Emergency call, the authorization is rejected if this value  = 0. My
specific question is whether there are any other documents other than the
three mentioned that I can refer to when going through the code?

Thanks,

--

Hello all,

The new FHoSS, which is updating the HSS functionality to the Release 7
requirements of 3GPP is now available for use. For the moment
it can be downloaded only from the branches, but very soon will be
placed it in the trunk.
The address for the download is:
	<A HREF="svn://svn.berlios.de/openimscore/FHoSS/branches/01_RevampDB">svn://svn.berlios.de/openimscore/FHoSS/branches/01_RevampDB</A>

I am inviting all the interested persons to take it and test it in your
testbeds and contact me with bug reports if you notice
any problems.

Although not 100% of the features specified in the specs were
implemented, the main features in which we were directly interested were
covered. Some of the new features of FHoSS include:

 - implicit registration sets and shared public identities;
 - synchronization support for ISIMs clients (on Cx and Zh interfaces);
 - IFC support for registered and unregistered users &amp; Shared IFC Sets
support;
 - Capabilities &amp; Capability Sets support;
 - improved Cx-events support: PPR and RTR
  (PPR and RTR messages are triggered manually at certain moments of
time to improve efficiency.)
 - improved Sh-notification system for Sh interface; (Please notice that
the sh-notification mechanism for IFCs has to be enabled from
 configuration file as it is disabled by default. Read the installation
guide carefully!)
 - improved web-interface for provisioning user-data;
 - new authentication methods: AKAv2, MD5, Digest, HTTP-Digest, NASS
Bundled, Early IMS;


The communication interfaces supported currently by the HSS are the same
three: Cx, Sh and Zh.	

The installation guide was updated and should contain enough information
in order to configure and start the new FHoSS. However, if you
encounter any problems please contact me.

Important Notice!
Please notice that the HSS database was changed a little bit, so the old
scripts for user provisioning are not working any more. Please
use the &quot;userdata.sql&quot; as a model. Moreover, a simple default
configuration with 2 users is already provided in the same file.

Thank you for your help and I am looking forward for your comments.

Regards,
Adrian

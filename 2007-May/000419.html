<PRE>hi Dragos,
                I have got a requirement that once 
                    client 1  INVITEs client 2 and the client 2 acknowledges
it, A billing table in the Database should get updated every 1 minute until
a CANCEL is sent from any of the clients.
 
The purpose of the set up is that,say a client has 300 credits ..These
credits get reduced as long as the client is in the call. Once this credit
becomes ,the client should no longer be allowed to make further calls ,also
the current call must get disconnected by server (It sends CANCEL).
 
 
    Is the above feature available in the DB?
If yes ,can anyone let me know as to how that works from S-CSCF via HSS?
 
Regards,
Abhishek.R.S

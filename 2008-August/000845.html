<PRE>Hi Franz,

</I>
Okay. This is the first difference. To me, it looks like the SAR/SAA
is intended to be sent  after successful registration or after a
failed registration. This is why the SAR's ServerAssignmentType can be
10 different values including Authentication-Failed,
Authentication-Timeout, Timeout-Deregistration etc. (These are listed
in page 20 of 29.229)

If you think the SAR can only be sent on successful registration, what
do you think the SAR types Authentication-Failed,
Authentication-Timeout aer for? These are defined values in 29.229 and
their behaviour is defined in 29.228

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The procedure which is applied when authentication data are downloaded from

</I>&gt;<i> HSS shall set the Public User Identity's authentication pending flag which
</I>&gt;<i> is specific to the Private User Identity which was received in the request.
</I>&gt;<i> The Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> So we are still in the MAR/MAA procedure.
</I>
I agree that the process that is used to download auth data is 6.3.1.
I'm not sure what you mean by we are still in MAR/MAA.  The SAR/SAA
exchange if it happens should happen after the MAR/MAA exchange

&gt;<i> There is no timeout set in S-CSCF and if the user equipment cannot register
</I>&gt;<i> successfully the authentication pending flag will remain set. There will not
</I>&gt;<i> be a SAR/SAA procedure as long as there is no successful registration.
</I>
The spec does define that the S-CSCF can send a SAR with a type of
Authentication-Failure or Authentication-Timeout. If these are sent,
these would be after the MAR/MAA exchange.

&gt;<i> The authentication pending flag is assigned to the Public User Identity
</I>&gt;<i> specific to the Private User Identity.
</I>
Yes, I agree. I quoted this too. I read this to mean that the
IMPI_IMPU  should have the flag set.

&gt;<i>  So we have the user flag set in IMPI
</I>&gt;<i> and in IMPI_IMPU table. This seems obvious to me.
</I>
Did you mean IMPU instead of IMPI. The code currently sets it on the
IMPI_IMPU and the IMPU objects.

This is where the second difference is. The spec only mentions that
the Public User Identity specific to the PrivateUserIdentity should
have the flag set. This I believe translates to the IMPI_IMPU object
meaning that the flag should be set in the IMPI_IMPU object. But the
current code also sets it in the IMPU object. The question is why do
we also set it in the IMPU object? Once we understand the first
difference, then this can be handled as it is mostly implementation
detail.

The spec defines a way to set the AuthPending flag. And it defines a
way to clear it.They both are defined exactly the same as far as where
- on which object - this pending flag is being cleared from. The only
diff is one sets it and the other clears it. So clearing after setting
it should leave the user back where he was as far as the Auth Pending
state goes.  Problem is the current code does not behave this way. It
sets it in  two object (the MAR code sets it in IMPI_IMPU and the IMPU
objects) but clears it from only one object (the SAR
Auth-Timeout/Auth-Failure code clears it only from the IMPI_IMPU).
This by itself indicates to me that the code is not doing something
right. It should be clearing it from the same objects that it is
setting it in.

Hope I explained myself more clearly here.

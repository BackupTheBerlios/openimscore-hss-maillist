<PRE>Hi Sundar,
 
&gt;<i> If you think the SAR can only be sent on successful registration, what
</I>&gt;<i> do you think the SAR types Authentication-Failed,
</I>&gt;<i> Authentication-Timeout are for? These are defined values in 29.229 and
</I>&gt;<i> their behaviour is defined in 29.228
</I>
I agree. From my point of view there is some text missing in TS 29.228
&#167;6.3.1. After HSS downloads the SIP-Auth-Data-Item and sets the Public User
Identity&#146;s authentication pending flag there should be a timer set in
S-CSCF. After timeout or several unsuccessful authentication attempts the
S-CSCF should send a SAR with the above mentioned Server-Assignment-Type AVP
values.

I did not look into the code, but according to your finding there is some
timeout procedure implemented.

&gt;<i> The spec does define that the S-CSCF can send a SAR with a type of
</I>&gt;<i> Authentication-Failure or Authentication-Timeout. If these are sent,
</I>&gt;<i> these would be after the MAR/MAA exchange.
</I>
Yes. As stated above.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; So we have the user flag set in IMPI
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and in IMPI_IMPU table. This seems obvious to me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Did you mean IMPU instead of IMPI. The code currently sets it on the
</I>&gt;<i> IMPI_IMPU and the IMPU objects.
</I>
Yes. Sorry, I meant IMPU.

&gt;<i> This is where the second difference is. The spec only mentions that
</I>&gt;<i> the Public User Identity specific to the PrivateUserIdentity should
</I>&gt;<i> have the flag set. This I believe translates to the IMPI_IMPU object
</I>&gt;<i> meaning that the flag should be set in the IMPI_IMPU object. But the
</I>&gt;<i> current code also sets it in the IMPU object. The question is why do
</I>&gt;<i> we also set it in the IMPU object? Once we understand the first
</I>&gt;<i> difference, then this can be handled as it is mostly implementation
</I>&gt;<i> detail.
</I>
This I cannot answer. It is an implementation detail and in my view - it
does not hurt as long as it handled symmetric regarding set and reset.

&gt;<i> The spec defines a way to set the AuthPending flag. And it defines a
</I>&gt;<i> way to clear it. They both are defined exactly the same as far as where
</I>&gt;<i> - on which object - this pending flag is being cleared from. The only
</I>&gt;<i> diff is one sets it and the other clears it. So clearing after setting
</I>&gt;<i> it should leave the user back where he was as far as the Auth Pending
</I>&gt;<i> state goes.  Problem is the current code does not behave this way. It
</I>&gt;<i> sets it in  two object (the MAR code sets it in IMPI_IMPU and the IMPU
</I>&gt;<i> objects) but clears it from only one object (the SAR
</I>&gt;<i> Auth-Timeout/Auth-Failure code clears it only from the IMPI_IMPU).
</I>&gt;<i> This by itself indicates to me that the code is not doing something
</I>&gt;<i> right. It should be clearing it from the same objects that it is
</I>&gt;<i> setting it in.
</I>
I did not look into the code. Maybe Dragos can comment on this.

I never detected that the AuthPending flag is reset. I always have the
situation that after offering wrong credentials during authentication the
S-CSCF requests an additional authentication vector and HSS denies this
request (DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY). In this case the AuthPending flag is
never reset. This behaviour also seems worth to dig deeper. I will do that
later.

Regards
Franz

<PRE>Hello Beatriz,

well, this is the way that it was before the Rel.7 revamp and the change
was for good reasons.

First, the real usage case is that no operator would do this. I mean, if
you change a little SPT condition you could trigger a flood of PPRs that
would probably kill the S-CSCF and HSS. You know, when you call your
operator to change something on your account, they usually tell you that
they did the change and that you will see changes in a few
minutes/hours/next day. This is because they have a throttling mechanism
for pushing changes. Well, we don't so far, so it is better to let the
operator do it manually. Anyway, they probably won't notice when doing
the change how many users are affected by that change.

Second, trying to write the queries to find all the users affected is
quite complex and maybe not worth the trouble.

Third, you will also have to implement a way of versioning the service
profiles. This is because your changes are not atomically probably and
when you update something and change like the AS uri, a SPT condition
and a IFC priority you will have 3xPPR, which will possibly be
inconsistent if you push them individually (not to mention too many PPRs).

So :). I would be for automatic-PPRs if it is done right, but after all
the points before, it seems overkill for such a small feature. For
partial support it would still be acceptable for the trunk if you
provide a configuration switch for it.

For the Sh interface it is a different story as the receivers (app
servers) are with several orders of magnitude fewer than the Cx
interface ones (subscribers).

Cheers,
-Dragos

</I>&gt;<i> Don&#180;t you think that both notifications should be launched the same

</I>&gt;<i> If you agree, we could fix that and upload the corrected files to the

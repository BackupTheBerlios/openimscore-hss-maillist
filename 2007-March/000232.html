</I>Or if you decide that we move too slow and would like to help, we are of
course welcoming any development help. The 01_RevampDB and the
01/02_persistency branches are perfect examples where we would hope to
see contributions.

The development contributed by FOKUS comes from two directions:
- first the things that our partners are willing to invest resources
into. For them our team prioritizes the tasks and we have clear
deadlines and standards to follow.
- then the best effort developments that we are doing in parallel. These
requirements come directly from these mailing lists and as such follow
what the large community would like to have as part of the project. If
somebody decides to fund and support such features, they are moved to
the previous group of tasks.
- integration of external developments coming from the developments.
when we get help, we happily integrate it and we would like to let
anybody work on branches as long as there will be a relative short term
of merging the changes into the main trunk so that we could all benefit
from the contributions.

Of course that we would like to have everything in the first and third
groups, but the reality is that resources are very limited. As you have
probably noticed, the Rel.7 upgrades are now into the best-effort task
group.

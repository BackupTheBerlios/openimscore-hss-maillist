<PRE>Hi Sundar,

&gt;<i> I ran into this problem after sending a MAR and hten following it up
</I>&gt;<i> with a SAR with ServerAssignmentType == Authentication_Timeout. Pcaps
</I>&gt;<i> showed a response of Diameter Success for both the MAR and the SAR but
</I>&gt;<i> the auth pending flag stills is set for the user when I look at it
</I>&gt;<i> using hte web ui for the public user identity. The Reg Status is shown
</I>&gt;<i> as Auth-Pending. How do I clear this flag?
</I>
The &quot;Auth-Pending&quot; state is the intermediate state between the two
registration transactions. The state flag is changed automatically when you
later succeed with a register transaction (-&gt; &quot;Registered&quot;) and when you
than de-register (-&gt; &quot;Not-Registered&quot;) or after timeout (re-registration
missing). But in TS 29.228 there is no timeout procedure for the
&quot;Auth-Pending&quot; state defined. 

If you have no chance to clear it via re-registration and a following
de-registration and you don't like the &quot;Auth-Pending&quot; state in the database
you can clear it &quot;by force&quot; in the hss_db database.  

&gt;<i> I don't understand the code or the data model well but looking at the
</I>&gt;<i> source code for the MAR, I did notice that in MAR.java:302 -  the
</I>&gt;<i> DB_Op.setUserState call - we set the user-state to AuthPending, but we
</I>&gt;<i> also set the apply_on_IMPU flag to true. Should this be false? The
</I>&gt;<i> spec 29.228 on page 27 says &quot;The HSS shal set the Public User
</I>&gt;<i> Identity's authentication flag which is specific to the Private User
</I>&gt;<i> Identity received in the request&quot;. That sounds like there is an IMPU
</I>&gt;<i> associated with each IMPI (maybe the IMPI_IMPU class) and the auth
</I>&gt;<i> pending flag should only be set at that level instead of for the IMPU
</I>&gt;<i> itself. Is that correct?
</I>
Yes I think so. At the registration there is always an IMPI and an IMPU
involved (maybe also more IMPUs in case of implicit registration). In TS
29.228 you can always read &quot;Public User Identity's authentication pending
flag&quot; therfore the flag is always associated with the IMPU.

Regards
Franz

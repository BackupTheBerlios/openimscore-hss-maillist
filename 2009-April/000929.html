<PRE>Hi Juan Miguel,

yes, what you see is the intended behavior. So the routing mechanism is 
somehow following the Diameter recommendations. The metrics are there to 
order the hosts, but not necessarily to do a round-robin balancing. In 
fact we have never considered this. The metric-ordered host list is then 
used to find the first connected peer to send to.

For balancing you would need to use some sort of load-balancer that 
would proxy messages based on the balancing rule. I wrote in the past 
something like this and it is quite easy to get one if you use the 
JavaDiameterPeer.

Then you should be aware of the Subscriber Location Function (SLF) in 
IMS, which practically splits the subscriber base between different 
HSSs. We do not support unfortunately yet the required Dx interface for 
example so that this would work in redirect mode, but if you build one 
in proxy mode it would work even faster, although you would create a bit 
of a sensitive bottleneck point of failure.

In case that you won't use an SLF, so when you don't want to fragment 
the subscriber base, then you need to also consider the fact that you 
will need to keep your DB back-ends in sync. If you have just one 
back-end for all you won't get much performance improvement through 
multile HSSs anyway as most of an HSS efforts would be actually wasted 
in the DBMS.

Now getting back to the realm-routing. In case that you are interested 
in contributing a load-balancing extra future, I would be very 
interested in accepting such a patch. It could work such that 
additionally to the metric, you could attach and extra balancing factor 
to each host. Then for connected hosts with the same metric a balancing 
algorithm could be employed to select one based on history and the 
balancing factors.

Cheers,
-Dragos

</I>&gt;<i> The problem in an scenario with two hss is that ALL the requests (around
